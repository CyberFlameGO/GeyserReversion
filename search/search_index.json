If you've heard of ViaVersion then this is the equivalent but for the Bedrock side of Geyser. It allows any of the supported client versions listed below to connect to any of the supported server versions. Features \u00b6 Minecraft Educational Edition Support Multiversion Support - As more versions of an edition become available they can be added Client Versions Supported \u00b6 Minecraft Bedrock \u00b6 Minecraft Bedrock v1.16.0 Minecraft Bedrock v1.16.2 Minecraft Bedrock v1.16.3 Minecraft Bedrock v1.16.100 Minecraft Education \u00b6 Minecraft Education v1.14.31 Minecraft Education v1.14.50 Server Versions Supported \u00b6 Minecraft Bedrock v1.16.2 Minecraft Bedrock v1.16.3 Minecraft Bedrock v1.16.100 Quick Start \u00b6 Make sure you are running a build of Geyser that supports native extensions. You can find a prebuilt one here . Down the latest GeyserReversion and place it inside your Geyser extensions folder. Note this is a folder 'extensions' underneath your Geyser folder. If you are running a plugin version of Geyser (Spigot/Bungeecord/Velocity) then make sure to place it inside the plugins/Geyser/extensions folder. Standalone verison of Geyser will be a extensions folder where your Geyser.jar file is located. Start Geyser. It should show some indication that GeyserReversion is running. For example: [11:08:37 INFO] {GeyserReversion} EducationServer listening on /0.0.0.0:19133 [11:08:37 DEBUG] {GeyserReversion} Registered Translator: Translator_v390ee_to_v408be If using education you will need to generate a token for each tenancy that you support otherwise you'll get a \"School not allowed\" error. See education docs for more info Donations \u00b6 As this is an open source project it is free to use and free to modify. If you do wish to donate then you may use the following link with all funds going into my \"Evening Fund\". The Evening Fund is a fund I (bundabrg) have set up for all my open source projects. Anything sent there will be used to help others. I appreciate your contribution, and I thank you for giving me the ability to bring some happiness to others as well.

By default a Minecraft Educational Client can only connect to another Minecraft Education Client who is part of the same Microsoft Tenancy. The server has to have a token for each tenancy that it will allow logins for. It can support multiple tenancies at the same time. Generating a Token \u00b6 To generate a token you will need to enter the following geyser command: /geyser education new This will provide a URL that a user in the tenancy must open in their browser (any user in the tenancy is fine). This will allow them to log into Microsoft as usual. They will end up with a white screen and a long address in their address bar. This address needs to be copied. Then enter the following geyser command: /geyser education confirm {copied address} This will generate the appropriate token. This token only allows the server access to the minecraft part of the account and if the user ever changes their Microsoft password the token will no longer be valid. Now any user in that same tenancy will be able to connect. Notes \u00b6 Minecraft Education uses the Tenancy username as the player username.
